# Project `get_next_line`

## Description
This project is part of the 42 curriculum, focusing on creating a function called `get_next_line`. The function reads from a file descriptor (such as `stdin` or a file) and returns a line terminated by a newline character (`'\n'`). The project aims to enhance your understanding of file manipulation, memory allocation, and handling of static variables in C.

## Requirements
- A C compiler (gcc/clang recommended)
- Basic knowledge of C programming
- Understanding of file descriptors and memory allocation
